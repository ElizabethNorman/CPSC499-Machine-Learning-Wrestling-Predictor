# CPSC499 Machine Learning Wrestling Predictor

We, Elizabeth and Nicholas, teamed up for the team project for CSPC 499, Mathematics of Machine Learning. We ventured forth to try to make a prediction model for professional wrestling, focusing in on the company All Elite Wrestling. As fans of professional wrestling, we undertook this project knowing that wrestling is scripted and that we were likely going to come up with much. 

However, suprisingly, taking in data features from both in and out of kayfabe, we were able to produce a somewhat effective model? Either way, it was a fun project for both of us to explore something we both love, we hope you enjoy reading our silly little results.
