# A note on the data collection files

The python files found in this folder contain very coarse, unprofessional examples of programming as this was just me working alone with a webcrawler and parser
to fill out data for use in our other, actually being submitted for grading, files. I just wanted to show how we put the data together for curious minds. 
I worked in the IDE and commented out stuff I didn't need at the moment.
